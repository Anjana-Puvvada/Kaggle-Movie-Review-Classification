# Classification of Kaggle Movie Reviews

## Project Description
This project aims to classify and predict the sentiment of movie reviews using the Kaggle movie reviews dataset. The sentiment classification scale ranges from 0 to 4, where:
- **0**: Negative
- **1**: Strong Negative
- **2**: Neutral
- **3**: Positive
- **4**: Strong Positive

The dataset is based on movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, annotated for sentiment analysis.

## Key Components

### Data Description
- **Training Data**: 156,060 entries with columns `PhraseId`, `SentenceId`, `Phrase`, and `Phrase Sentiment`.
- **Testing Data**: 66,292 entries with columns `PhraseId`, `SentenceId`, and `Phrase`.

### Data Preprocessing
- Reading and loading data into the Python environment.
- Tokenization and filtering of phrases.
- Pre-processing steps include:
  - Removing punctuation.
  - Converting text to lowercase.
  - Removing stop words.

### Feature Engineering
- **Bag of Words (BOW)/Unigram Features**: Creating lists of most frequent words.
- **Sentiment Lexicons**: Using positive and negative word counts from a lexicon.
- **Negation Word Features**: Handling negation words to accurately capture sentiment.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Features**: Using POS tags to identify syntactic patterns.
- **Bigram and Trigram Features**: Creating high-frequency bigram and trigram features.
- **Combined Feature Sets**: Combining multiple feature sets for improved accuracy.

### Classification Algorithms
- **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier (NLTK)**: Implemented with various feature sets (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, POS, etc.).
- **Logistic Regression (Scikit-Learn)**: Utilized with different feature sets and evaluated for precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Support Vector Machines (Scikit-Learn)**: Applied to different feature sets and analyzed for performance.
- **Decision Tree Classifier (Scikit-Learn)**: Used with various feature sets to classify sentiments.

### Results and Observations
